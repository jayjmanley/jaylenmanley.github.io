### Instructions

Prepare the Sauce:
In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, cornstarch, chicken broth, sesame oil, and honey. Set aside.
Cook the Chicken:
Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.
Add the chicken and cook for 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden and cooked through. Remove and set aside.
Stir-Fry the Vegetables:
In the same skillet, add the remaining oil.
Stir in garlic and ginger, cooking for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
Add the vegetables and stir-fry for 4-5 minutes, until tender but still crisp.
Combine Chicken and Sauce:
Return the chicken to the skillet with the vegetables.
Pour the sauce over the chicken and vegetables, stirring to coat evenly.
Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, until the sauce thickens and everything is heated through.
Serve and Enjoy:
Serve the stir-fry over rice or noodles.
Garnish with sesame seeds and green onions if desired.
